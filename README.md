## Hackerearth-Udaan-Movie-Ticket

### Problem Statement
<b> You have to write the backend logic of a system that is used in Movie Theatres. The functionalities include : </b> <br /> <br /> 
1. [ ADD SCREEN ] Say you have a screen empty and you want to allot this screen to a new movie. <br /> 
Params : <br /> 
a) screen-name or the Name of the Screen. Example : "Avengers- Infinity War". <br /> 
b) rows : Total rows in the Audi <br /> 
c) cols : Total cols in the Audi<br /> 
d) Aisle-Seats : Which seats are to be kept aisle. Example 5, 6 and 12, 13 are aisle seats in every row of the Audi. <br /> 

### Things to keep in mind
1. Udaan asks the same questions for both Intern and FTE postions.
2. The problem statement is that you have to complete the functionality of :    
    a) add-screen {screen-name} {rows} {cols} {aisle-seats} <br />
    b) reserve-seat {screen-name} {row-number} {seats-to-book} <br />
    c) get-unreserved-seats {screen-name} {row-number} <br />
    d) suggest-contiguous-seats {screen-name} {number-of-contiguous-seats} {row-number} {preferred-starting-or-ending-seat-number} <br />
3. Time Allowed : 2 hrs. <br />
### FAQ
Q.) Is this tested enough ? <br />
A.) No, it's not, I wasn't able to solve the contiguous part and don't exactly think that my implementation is correct. So use your brains etc., this is just a reference implementation that may/maynot work.

Q.) Is OOPS needed ? <br />
A.) I think so because they needed good engineering practices to be followed. <br /> 


#### How I performed ?
Bad Ofcourse, I couldn't complete the contiguous-logic, because normal development is done on some IDE/text-editor but the Hackerearth IDE is fu**ed up, you can't get full-screen, also the question is described vaguely and there is no debugger in the IDE.</br>
