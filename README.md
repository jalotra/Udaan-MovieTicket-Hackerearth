## Hackearth-Udaan-Movie-Ticket

### Things to keep in mind
1. Udaan asks the same questions for both Intern and FTE postions.
2. The problem statement is that you have to complete the functionality of :    
    a) add-screen {screen-name} {rows} {cols} {aisle-seats} <br />
    b) reserve-seat {screen-name} {row-number} {seats-to-book} <br />
    c) get-unreserved-seats {screen-name} {row-number} <br />
    d) suggest-contiguous-seats {screen-name} {number-of-contiguous-seats} {row-number} {preferred-starting-or-ending-seat-number} <br />

#### How I performed ?
Bad Ofcourse, I couldn't complete the contiguous-logic, because normal development is done on some IDE/text-editor but the Hackerearth IDE is fu**ed up, you can't get full-screen, also the question is described vaguely and there is no debugger in the IDE.</br>
